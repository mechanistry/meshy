# Meshy
Meshy is an open-source 3D file format that allows for storage of geometry (mesh) information usable in various 3D software. It was created with the primary goal of simplifying animation pipeline and improving performance in the Unity game engine. It allows to take advantage of VAT (Vertex Animation Texture) animations that can replace existing animation implementations, increasing rendering performance and simplifying model creation process. Due to its open nature (based on Google Protocol Buffers) and serialization structure, Meshy allows for an easy integration not only with Unity, but also other 3D engines, design software and various tools.
